# C++ VS Python speed comparison

This projects aims at using C++ functions and classes in Python and compare their execution speeds to equivalent Python implementations.

The project has been run on MacOS Sonoma 14.4.1, using Python 3.11.8 and C++17.

Libraries required:
- `pybind11` to run C++ in Python.
- `snakeviv` for profiling.

## Compiling C++ code with CMake.

I used the following tutorial to compile the C++ project with CMake: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbDuTtqA8-k&ab_channel=DivyenduNarayan.

Summary:
- Create the .cpp and the CMakeLists.txt files.
- cd to the projectâ€™s directory.
- Run the following command lines
  - rmdir -rf build (delete the existing build directory)
  - mkdir build (create the build directory)
  - cd build (move to the build director)
  - cmake .. (create the MakeFile)
  - make (run the MakeFile)

In short:
- rmdir -rf build
- mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

## Use pybind to call the C++ function in Python.

I relied on the following tutorial: https://www.matecdev.com/posts/cpp-call-from-python.html.

## Profiling a Python file.

I looked at the following tutorial: https://kirillstrelkov.medium.com/easy-python-profiling-a70cbf699295.

- `pip install snakeviz` if needed.
- Run the profiling Python script: `python -m cProfile -o /tmp/tmp.prof profiler.py`.
- Visualize the results: `snakeviz /tmp/tmp.prof`.

In short:
- `python -m cProfile -o /tmp/tmp.prof profiler.py; snakeviz /tmp/tmp.prof`
